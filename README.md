# Data Structures Game Hub: Connect Four and Wordle

This project builds upon Ben and Josh's Comp-127 project by building a second iteration to the game hub they designed in the previous semester.
This game hub creates Connect Four and Wordle games along with a central hub wher you can choose which game you want to play by typing in the name of the game. 

Built by Ben King, Josh Planko, and Luke Moore for the Comp 128 Spring Semseter Final project in April of 2024.
