Welcome to Connect Four!

The rules of the game are simple. Players take turns placing a piece in one of the available columns on the board
by typing in the number of the column they would like to place the piece in in the text field labelled on the screen. 
The goal of connect four is to line up four of the same colored pieces in a row, whether that be vertically, horizontally, or diagonally, anything counts!
